    <h1>Some of my favorite sites</h1>
    <h2>Wikipedia</h2>
    <p>
      One of my favorite websites is called 
      <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a>. 
      This terrific site allows ordinary users to enter 
      encyclopedia definitions. Over time, the entries 
      can be as reliable as a commercial encyclopedia, 
      and a lot more complete.

    <h2>Dummies</h2>
    <p>
      You can find out a lot more about upcoming and current 
      Dummies books at <a href="http://www.dummies.com/">Dummies</a>. 
      You might even find this book mentioned there.
